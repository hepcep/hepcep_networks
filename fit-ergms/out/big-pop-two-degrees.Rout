NOTE: Versions before 3.6.1 had a bug in the implementation of the bd()
constriant which distorted the sampled distribution somewhat. In
addition, Sampson's Monks datasets had mislabeled vertices. See the
NEWS and the documentation for more details.

NOTE: If you use custom ERGM terms based on 'ergm.userterms' version
prior to 3.1, you will need to perform a one-time update of the package
boilerplate files (the files that you did not write or modify) from
'ergm.userterms' 3.1 or later. See help('eut-upgrade') for
instructions.
