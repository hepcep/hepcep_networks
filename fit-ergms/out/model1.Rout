NOTE: Versions before 3.6.1 had a bug in the implementation of the bd()
constriant which distorted the sampled distribution somewhat. In
addition, Sampson's Monks datasets had mislabeled vertices. See the
NEWS and the documentation for more details.

NOTE: Some common term arguments pertaining to vertex attribute and
level selection have changed in 3.10.0. See terms help for more
details. Use 'options(ergm.term=list(version="3.9.4"))' to use old
behavior.

NOTE: If you use custom ERGM terms based on 'ergm.userterms' version
prior to 3.1, you will need to perform a one-time update of the package
boilerplate files (the files that you did not write or modify) from
'ergm.userterms' 3.1 or later. See help('eut-upgrade') for
instructions.

The log-likelihood improved by 1.5.
MCMLE estimation did not converge after 500 iterations. The estimated coefficients may not be accurate. Estimation may be resumed by passing the coefficients as initial values; see 'init' under ?control.ergm for details.
Finished MCMLE.
This model was fit using MCMC.  To examine model diagnostics and check
